# Todo List

You are required to develop a simple Todo List application using ReactJS. The application should allow users to add, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, users should be able to mark tasks as completed or pending.

## Requirements

<input type="checkbox" /> The application should have a clean and intuitive user interface.

<input type="checkbox" /> Users should be able to add a new task by entering a title and description.

<input type="checkbox" /> Users should be able to edit the title and description of an existing task.

<input type="checkbox" /> Users should be able to mark a task as completed or pending.

<input type="checkbox" /> Users should be able to delete a task.

<input type="checkbox" /> Implement form validation to ensure that the required fields are filled out correctly.

<input type="checkbox" /> The application should display a list of tasks, with the ability to filter tasks based on their completion status (completed, pending, or all).

<input type="checkbox" /> The application should persist the tasks locally so that they are not lost upon page refresh.
